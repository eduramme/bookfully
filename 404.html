        The meta tag below is used to redirect any 404 (Not Found) errors to the base path of the application.
        This issue arises when hosting a Single Page Application (SPA) on a platform like GitHub Pages,
        which serves static files and does not natively support SPAs' client-side routing.

        When a user navigates directly to a path other than the root (e.g., by refreshing the browser
        on a non-root route), the server tries to find a file at that location. As there's no file
        corresponding to the path, a 404 error occurs. 

        By redirecting all 404 errors to the base path of the application, the SPA's client-side routing
        can then take over and handle the intended route properly. 

        It's a workaround necessary because GitHub Pages doesn't offer a way to redirect all non-root requests
        back to the root by default, which is what's typically required for SPAs to function correctly on direct navigation to non-root paths.
